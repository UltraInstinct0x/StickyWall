## Digital Wall: User-Generated Content Curation Platform

### Executive Summary
A user-uploaded content curation platform where users share content directly through native OS share menus. Zero scraping, zero copyright violations, maximum vibes. Users control what they share, creating a truly decentralized taste graph.

### Core Business Model
**The Genius Move**: We're not stealing content - we're providing a sharing destination. Like how WhatsApp isn't liable for your memes, we're just the wall where people stick their digital finds.

### Value Proposition
- **Problem**: Fragmented content across platforms, no unified curation space
- **Solution**: Native share integration making "Digital Wall" a default sharing option
- **Differentiator**: User-initiated sharing = zero copyright liability

### Target Audience
1. **Primary**: Digital natives who already share to Instagram stories, WhatsApp groups
2. **Secondary**: Content curators looking for portfolio alternatives
3. **Tertiary**: Brands wanting to understand organic sharing patterns

### Business Objectives (Year 1)
- 100K registered users with native app installed
- 1M pieces of content shared organically
- 50% WAU/MAU ratio (stickiness metric)
- Zero copyright strikes (this is a feature, not a bug)

### Revenue Streams
1. **Freemium Model**
   - Free: 1 wall, 100 items limit
   - Premium: Unlimited walls, analytics, export features
   
2. **Automation Tier** (The Spicy Play)
   - Users DM content to our platform accounts
   - Auto-upload to their walls via authorized automation
   - Premium feature: "Share via DM" convenience

3. **Enterprise API**
   - Anonymized taste graph data
   - Trend detection algorithms
   - Content virality predictions

### Legal Framework
- **Content Ownership**: Users upload their own screenshots/content
- **Platform Status**: Safe harbor under Section 230 equivalent
- **DMCA Compliance**: Standard notice-and-takedown procedure
- **Turkish Advantage**: Favorable jurisdiction for platform liability

### Success Metrics
- Share menu adoption rate
- Content diversity index
- Cross-wall discovery rate
- User retention (D7, D30)
- Premium conversion rate

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Legal**: User-generated only, clear TOS, DMCA compliance
2. **Technical**: Distributed storage, progressive web app first
3. **Market**: Focus on underserved "casual curator" segment
4. **Competitive**: Network effects through taste matching
