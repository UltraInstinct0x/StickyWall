# MVP Roadmap - 6 Week Sprint to Launch
## "From Zero to Native Share Menu Supremacy"

### Pre-Sprint: Foundation (Week 0)

| 1 | Share handler works | Can share from Safari/Chrome to PWA |
| 2 | Native extensions | iOS/Android share menus include our app |
| 3 | AI understands content | Shared links get meaningful metadata |
| 4 | Walls are persistent | Users can create and manage walls |
| 5 | It looks good | Your designer friend doesn't roast you |

### MVP Feature Cuts (What We're NOT Building)
- ‚ùå DM automation (P1 feature)
- ‚ùå Taste graph algorithm (P1 feature)
- ‚ùå Collaborative walls
- ‚ùå Export functionality
- ‚ùå Payment processing
- ‚ùå Advanced analytics

### Risk Register & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Apple rejects share extension | High | PWA-first strategy, Safari share fallback |
| Share API browser support | Medium | Clipboard fallback, clear instructions |
| Storage costs explode | Medium | Aggressive limits for free tier |
| DMCA spam | Low | Automated handling, clear TOS |

### Post-MVP Immediate Priorities
1. **Week 7-8**: DM automation for premium
2. **Week 9-10**: Taste graph algorithm
3. **Week 11-12**: Discovery feed

### Success Metrics for MVP
- 1000 shares in first week
- 100 active walls
- <2s page load on 4G
- 50% mobile traffic
- Zero copyright strikes

### The DMCA Reality Check
**Can you forward to /dev/null?** Legally no, practically... still no üíÄ
- You MUST have a registered DMCA agent
- You MUST respond to valid notices
- You CAN automate the process
- You CAN'T ignore them without consequences

**The Smart Play**: 
1. Automated DMCA system that removes content immediately
2. Counter-notice process for users
3. Three-strike policy for repeat offenders
4. Turkish company structure for additional protection

Remember: Platforms get safe harbor protection IF they comply with DMCA. Don't be the genius who loses protection over laziness.
